# Network Content Module

A Lola module for network automation skills and workflows specific to Ansible network collections.
Contains community-facing skills for network device management, configuration, and validation.

## Installation

```bash
# Install Lola package manager
pip install lola-ai

# Register the module from GitHub
lola mod add https://github.com/ansible-community/ai-forge/network_content

# Or clone and register locally
git clone https://github.com/ansible-community/ai-forge.git
lola mod add ./ai-forge/network_content

# Install to Claude Code
lola install network_content -a claude-code

# Install to Cursor
lola install network_content -a cursor

# Install to other assistants
lola install network_content -a gemini-cli
lola install network_content -a opencode
```

## Components

### Skills

- **`network-collection-triage`** — Triage bug reports, CI failures, and GitHub issues across
  Ansible network collections. Supports scan mode (bulk weekly triage with structured JSON and
  markdown output) and direct mode (single issue deep triage). Includes known network CI failure
  pattern detection and cross-collection cascade analysis for shared dependencies (netcommon,
  utils). Requires only `gh` CLI.

## Scope

This module is for **public, community-facing** network automation skills.

### What is a Network Collection?

A **Network Collection** provides modules and plugins for managing network devices - routers, switches, firewalls, load balancers, and other network infrastructure.
These collections automate device configuration, state management, and operational tasks.

Examples: `cisco.ios`, `cisco.nxos`, `arista.eos`, `junipernetworks.junos`, `vyos.vyos`, `ansible.netcommon`

### What Makes Network Collections Different

Network collections have unique development patterns:

- **Connection**: Specialized plugins (`network_cli`, `netconf`, `httpapi`) instead of standard SSH
- **State handling**: Resource Modules with states: `merged`, `replaced`, `overridden`, `deleted`, `gathered`, `rendered`, `parsed`
- **Authentication**: Device credentials via `ansible_network_os`, `ansible_user`, `ansible_password`
- **Idempotency**: Parse running-config, compare to desired state, generate minimal config diff

### Planned Skills

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `resource-module-scaffold` | Generate Resource Module structure with argument spec, facts, and all state operations |
| `resource-module-parser` | Create parsers for extracting structured data from device CLI output |
| `network-facts-module` | Scaffold `*_facts` modules that populate `ansible_network_resources` |
| `netconf-module` | Generate NETCONF-based modules with proper XML/YANG handling |
| `httpapi-plugin` | Scaffold httpapi connection plugins for REST-based network devices |
| `network-config-diff` | Implement config comparison and minimal diff generation |
| `network-integration-tests` | Generate integration tests with device mocking patterns |

### Resource Module Pattern

Resource modules solve the "every vendor has different CLI syntax" problem:

```yaml
# Consistent interface across all platforms
- cisco.ios.ios_interfaces:
    config:
      - name: GigabitEthernet0/1
        enabled: true
    state: merged  # or replaced, overridden, deleted, gathered
```

The `resource-module-scaffold` skill would generate:

- Argument spec from a resource model
- `rm_builder` templates
- Config parsers for existing device output
- Each state operation implementation

### Example Use Cases

- Network device configuration validation
- Platform-specific module development
- Config backup and restore workflows
- Network topology analysis helpers
- Compliance checking against golden configs

Internal or business-specific network skills should be contributed to the private repository.
